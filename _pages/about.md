## About me
<br>
My name is Per Wilhelmsson and I am a biologist (BSc 2011) and bioinformatician (MSc 2013, PhD 2019) as well as a hobby microscopist, 3D-printist, roboticist and Copyleftist.
<br>
<br>
My <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Per-Wilhelmsson">research background</a> is in plant evolution with specific interest in plant terrestrialization and the early development of cellular life.
<br>
<br>
Since my bachelorâ€™s studies I have, on a hobby level, been exploring different solutions for automated microscopy working with microcontrollers, sensors and objective lenses. In 2020 I discovered the OpenFlexure project and have since had the great pleasure of playing around with the OpenFlexure microscope. I am convinced that initiatives such as the OpenFlexure project is the way of the future, elevating education and completely democratizing research and technology.
<br>
<br>
I am currently working on sustainable water use at <a href="https://www.swedenwaterresearch.se/en/">Sweden Water Research</a>. My goal is to be able to work full-time with developing, promoting and implementing open-source hardware solutions in education, research as well as for citizen science projects.
