    <td width="50%"><p style="font-size:22px">This project employs the <a href="https://openflexure.org/">OpenFlexure Microscope (OFM)</a>. OFM is an open-source microscope, meaning that the 3D schematics for the structural parts and assembly instructions, using of the shelf electronics, are openly available. The OFM is developed by the Bath Open INstrumentation Group (BOING) for the purpose of “making microscopes and micromanipulators, with precise mechanical positioning, available to anyone with a 3D printer”. </p>

    <td><p style="font-size:22px">The OFM is remote-controlled and can be printed and mounted in ~24h at a cost of less than 2,000SEK (plastics, electronics and optics included). Since it is completely open source it is highly customisable making it possible to employ the microscope for one’s specific application. Using the OFM it is possible to automate the photography of our samples.  </p>

    <td><p style="font-size:22px">The surface area (4cm2) of the bottom of the sediment chamber (one sample) can be scanned in ~3h 30min using a snake pattern. This results in ~1000 images. With the potential to documented more images than what one person can analyse, it is important to evaluate the usefulness of <strong>AI-assisted identification and quantification</strong>. </p>
