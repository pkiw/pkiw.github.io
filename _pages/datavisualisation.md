<p style="font-size:22px">With an increased capacity to collect and analyse data it is of highest priority that the output of this workflow is compiled in a way that is accessible and understandable. The end product of this workflow will consist of inventories providing the amount of specific organisms present in the analysed sample as well as measurements of organism size. This kind of basic data will be useful for researchers in understanding the dynamics of climate change and its effects on aquatic ecosystems. </p>

    <td><p style="font-size:22px">This figure (unpublished results) further highlights the demand of such inventory data. Using the available national database of environmental data (https://miljodata.slu.se/MVM/) we can see that in Skåne, the southmost province of Sweden, the observed diversity of freshwater phytoplankton highly correlates with the number of samples analysed. The only way to get rid of this bias, and get a clear view of the situation, is to collect and process more samples. This is what the BysjöBot project and workflow aims to fulfill.</p>
