## Build your own OFM

<p style="font-size:22px">The OpenFlexure projects provides all the <a href=" https://openflexure.org/projects/microscope/build"> information</a> needed to build your own OFM. If you have any issues during assembly you can turn to the <a href="https://openflexure.discourse.group/"> OF-forum</a>. The forum can be used as a great resource when troubleshooting. A slow version of my build-demo is available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwuFgYbz_MM">Youtube</a> (1h 14min).  </p>

If you don’t have a 3D-printer or the time to source all the required parts, the OpenFlexure Project provides a list of <a href="https://openflexure.org/about/vendors">vendors</a> to whom you can turn to for inquiries regarding different kits. 

## I am one of those vendors!

I offer <strong>kits</strong> of the "Low-cost" microscope version at a price of <strong>300€</strong> (including VAT but excluding postal fee). These kits include all pieces needed to completely assemble an OFM except for some tools (pozidrive screwdriver, 2.5 mm Ball-end Allen key and utility knife). These kits also include a SD-card (<a href=" https://openflexure.org/projects/microscope/install">Raspberian OpenFlexure OS</a>) and power supply. The only thing you would then need to get started with your microscope is a computer and an ethernet cable. Included in the 300€ is a donation of <strong>200SEK</strong> (~18€) that goes directly towards the OpenFlexure project via <a href="https://httrust.org/">Humanitarian Technology Trust</a>.

You can send an email to <strong>info@pkiutv.se</strong> with the amount of kits you are interested in and delivery address, and you will recieve an invoice. I provide help organising OFM build workshops. Feel free to send an email to <strong>info@pkiutv.se</strong> if you are interested in help arranging a workshop or have any other related inquires.
