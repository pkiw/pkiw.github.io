Large amounts of image data creates the need of ways to store it. An optimal soultion for this is to reposite your data in existing databases that are dedicated for longevity and are connected to global diversity initiatives. The citizen-science gallery of <a href="https://nordicmicroalgae.org/gallery/Citizen%20science/">Nordic Microalgae</a> (NuA)  is such a repository. This repository is being maintained by Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (<a href="https://www.smhi.se/en/about-smhi">SMHI</a>) and Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (<a href="https://biodiversitydata.se/">SBDI</a>). In turn, SBDI is a part of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (<a href="https://www.gbif.org/what-is-gbif">GBIF</a>), making sure the collected data ends up in relevant repositories. Here is a simplified <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ea6jsd973gn8mh254m999/Lathund_NordicMicroalgae.pdf?rlkey=ws931461pp5ag8iw1wk9jgshz&st=gm4hs6jw&dl=0"> user manual </a> describing how to upload images to NuA. <a href="https://www.artportalen.se/">Artportalen</a> is another great repository for environmental data collected in Sweden. <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>  is a global repository containing findings from all around the planet.

With user-friendly scalable open source tools, such as the OpenFlexure microscope, comes the possibility to collect image data over longer periods of time. A valuable format documenting change over time and capturing events otherwise difficult to observe in real time, such as generational change and slow motility.
