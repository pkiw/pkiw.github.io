To distinguish, identify and quantify microorganisms not only requires sufficient equipment (high magnification microscope) but foremost extensive taxonomic knowledge. This knowledge and skill is unfortunately in short supply and limited to a certain processing speed. If we are to process large amounts of data, for broad quantitative purpose, manual methodology becomes very expensive and time consuming.</p>
