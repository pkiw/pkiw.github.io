<h1> Environmental monitoring and the need of more data </h1>

Our ability to understand our environment depends on our capacity to collect and analyse data.
<br>
<br>
Microscopic organisms play an important role in the global ecosystem. With their geochemical importance, being involved in fixation and regeneration of the major organic building blocks (carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorous), they make up for the fundament in aquatic food webs and are the backbone in our global ecosystem. Access to healthy lakes and oceans is a prerequisite for drinking water production, recreation (e. g outdoor life and swimming) and business activities (e. g aquaculture and fishing).
Sweden's national database for environmental data has in recent decades only seen a marginal growth in the amount of annual incoming data. One of the reasons is that there has not been any major technical methodological invention, and collection of environmental data, especially from aquatic environments, is hampered by costly and time-consuming methodology.
<br>
<br>
Recent years advances in, and availability of, open-source hardware (through 3D printer technology) and open-source software (AI and machine learning) has enabled for a paradigm shift when it comes to manufacturing and implementation of cost-effective scientific equipment (open-source platforms).
<br>
<br>
This project aims to compile and share documentation guiding through the steps of manufacture, establishment and implementation of open-source platforms for the purpose of gathering and analysing aquatic microscopic image data. This workflow will cover the steps going from <strong>Sample collection</strong> through processesing (<strong>Microscopy</strong> and <strong>Image analysis</strong>) to <strong>Data visualisation</strong>.
