<h1> Environmental monitoring and the need of more data </h1>
Our ability to understand our environment depends on our capacity to collect and analyse data.
Gathering information regarding the microscopic content of a lake/ocean is an expensive endevour.
This should be as easy as 
Access to cost effective means to collect data makes it possible to more clearly visualise temporal and spatial distribution of aquatic microorganisms, at a time when a rapidly changing climatic pose an increasingly significant stress factor on aquatic ecosystems.
